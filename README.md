# PA-simulation-train-company
You work at the train company as an economist. Your boss asks you to calculate the annual income of the company. You have to be attentive because the company was unprofitable so far. There are 3 types of trains: Passenger, IC and Freight. It's important to have at least 2 of each train. Each train has a unique serial number. Every train has a cost: IC 1,200$/month, Passenger and Freight 1,000$/month. Between 115 and 250 people travel daily on the trains. The train ticket is 1.50$ for the passenger train, IC tickets cost 50 cents more because of the seat fare. 25% of people buy tickets on the train, which is 2 dollars more expensive in both cases. The freight train has no passengers. The revenue of the freight train is 550$/month. 

Other revenues:

If the freight train goes abroad (with a 35% chance per month), it adds 110$ to its revenue.

On the passenger train there is a 10% chance and on the IC there is an 8% chance each month that 20% of the travelers will be punished. Which means 6$ plus per person.

Your task is to simulate this train company for 2 years, and print its expenses, income and profits.
